## Decision #001: Comprehensive Path Chosen

**Date**: 2026-01-14
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Implementation Team
**Related Steps**: All

### Context

Three timeline options available:
- Accelerated (1-2 days, 75/100 score)
- Critical (3 days, 85/100 score)
- Comprehensive (1-2 weeks, 95-100/100 score)

User selected comprehensive path with 1-2 week timeline for principal engineer demo.

### Decision

Implement comprehensive path with all 10 steps for 95-100/100 demo execution score.

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Maximum confidence and preparation
- Measured performance evidence (not projections)
- Multiple backup plans tested
- Full dress rehearsal
- Resilience demonstration polished

**Negative**:
- Longer timeline (1-2 weeks vs 2-3 days)
- More effort required (16-20 hours vs 9-11 hours)

**Trade-off**: Worth the extra time for principal-level audience.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Critical Path** (3 days): Minimum viable, 85/100 score
   - Rejected: Insufficient confidence for principal audience
2. **Accelerated** (1-2 days): Emergency prep, 75/100 score
   - Rejected: Too rushed, high failure risk
