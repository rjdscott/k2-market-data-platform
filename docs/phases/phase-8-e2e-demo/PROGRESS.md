## Day 1 Timeline

**Morning (9:00 - 11:00)**: Step 01 - Environment Validation
- Current: ✅ Directory structure created
- In Progress: Docker stack health check
- Next: E2E test validation

**Midday (11:00 - 14:00)**: Step 02 - Demo Script Validation
- Validate all demo scripts functionality
- Test different execution modes
- Document script behavior

**Afternoon (14:00 - 16:00)**: Step 03 - Jupyter Notebook Validation  
- Execute all 3 notebooks completely
- Validate visualizations and outputs
- Check data analysis completeness
