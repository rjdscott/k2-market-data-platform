## Decision Log

### Recent Decisions
None yet - Phase just starting

### Pending Decisions
- D5-001: Connection rotation interval (4h vs 6h)
  - **Recommendation**: Start with 4h, tune based on memory metrics
  - **Owner**: Engineer
  - **Due**: After 12h validation test

- D5-002: Memory monitoring sampling interval (30s vs 60s)
  - **Recommendation**: 30s (better leak detection)
  - **Owner**: Engineer
  - **Due**: During Step 04 implementation

- D5-003: Soak test duration (24h vs 48h)
  - **Recommendation**: 24h (sufficient for 6-12h failure pattern)
  - **Owner**: Engineer
  - **Due**: Before Step 07 implementation

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Why is SSL verification disabled currently?
**A**: ✅ RESOLVED - SSL verification now enabled (Step 01 complete) with certifi certificate management.

### Q: Why 4 hour connection rotation?
**A**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Industry best practice for WebSocket connections is 4-6 hours to prevent memory/state accumulation. Conservative 4h starting point, can tune to 6h if memory stable.

### Q: Why is this Phase 5 instead of Phase 4?
**A**: This replaces the originally planned "Scale & Production" phase (which was too broad). This phase focuses specifically on Binance production resilience, which is the immediate priority.

### Q: What happens to the original Phase 5 plan?
**A**: The distributed scale-out work (Kubernetes, multi-region, Presto) is deferred to a future phase after single-node production stability is proven.

### Q: What's the difference between Step 04 (memory monitoring) and Step 05 (heartbeat)?
**A**: Step 04 detects memory leaks via linear regression analysis of memory samples. Step 05 detects silent connection drops via WebSocket ping-pong. Both are critical for production resilience.
