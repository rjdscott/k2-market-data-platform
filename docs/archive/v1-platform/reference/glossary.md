## Market Data Terms

### Core Concepts

**Tick**
: The smallest price movement in a financial instrument. Also refers to individual market data events (trades, quotes).

**Trade** (*Fill, Execution*)
: A completed transaction where a security changes hands. Contains: price, quantity, timestamp, side (buy/sell).

**Quote** (*Bid/Ask, Best Bid and Offer - BBO*)
: The current best prices at which market participants are willing to buy (bid) or sell (ask) a security.

**Bid Price**
: The highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a security.

**Ask Price** (*Offer Price*)
: The lowest price a seller is willing to accept for a security.

**Spread**
: The difference between the ask price and bid price. Indicates liquidity and transaction costs.

**Market Depth** (*Order Book, Level 2*)
: The quantity available at each price level beyond the best bid/ask. Shows market liquidity.

---

### Price and Volume Metrics

**OHLCV** (*Candlestick*)
: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume - standard aggregation of price data over a time interval.

**VWAP** (*Volume-Weighted Average Price*)
: Average price weighted by volume. Formula: `Σ(Price × Volume) / Σ(Volume)`. Used for execution quality benchmarks.

**TWAP** (*Time-Weighted Average Price*)
: Average price weighted by time. Used for execution strategies that spread orders over time.

**Last Price**
: The price of the most recent trade. May differ from current bid/ask.

**Mark Price**
: A calculated fair price used for margining and liquidations (crypto exchanges). Prevents manipulation.

---

### Order Types and Sides

**Market Order**
: Order to buy/sell immediately at the best available price. Guarantees execution but not price.

**Limit Order**
: Order to buy/sell at a specific price or better. Guarantees price but not execution.

**Side**
: Direction of trade/order - `BUY` (long) or `SELL` (short).

**Aggressor**
: The party that "took" liquidity by crossing the spread (market order or marketable limit order).

**Maker**
: The party that "provided" liquidity with a resting limit order.

---

### Time and Sequencing

**Trade Timestamp**
: The exchange-reported time when a trade occurred. May be exchange time or UTC.

**Ingestion Timestamp**
: The time K2 received the message. Used for latency tracking.

**Sequence Number**
: Monotonically increasing number assigned by the exchange to detect gaps and reordering.

**Message ID**
: UUID v4 generated by K2 for deduplication. Enables idempotent processing.

---

### Market Microstructure

**Latency Tier**
: Classification of data access speed:
  - **L1 (Hot Path)**: <10μs - Execution engines, market making
  - **L2 (Warm Path)**: <10ms - Real-time risk, P&L
  - **L3 (Cold Path)**: <500ms - Analytics, compliance (**K2's focus**)

**HFT** (*High-Frequency Trading*)
: Trading strategies operating at microsecond latencies. Requires L1 infrastructure. **Not K2's target**.

**Algo Trading** (*Algorithmic Trading*)
: Automated trading using predefined rules. May operate at L1, L2, or L3 depending on strategy.

---

### Asset Classes

**Equity** (*Stock*)
: Ownership share in a company. Traded on stock exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ, LSE).

**Crypto** (*Cryptocurrency, Digital Asset*)
: Digital currency using cryptography. Traded on crypto exchanges (Binance, Coinbase).

**FX** (*Foreign Exchange, Forex*)
: Currency pairs (EUR/USD). Largest and most liquid market globally.

**Fixed Income** (*Bonds*)
: Debt securities with fixed interest payments. Less liquid than crypto assets.

**Derivatives** (*Futures, Options*)
: Contracts deriving value from an underlying asset.

---

## K2 Platform Terms

### Architecture Components

**K2 Platform**
: The complete market data platform for analytics, compliance, and research. **L3 Cold Path** focused.

**Lakehouse**
: Hybrid architecture combining data lake (raw storage) + data warehouse (structured queries). K2 uses **Apache Iceberg**.

**Iceberg**
: Open table format providing ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time-travel queries on data lakes.

**DuckDB**
: Embedded analytical database used for queries in Phase 1-2. Zero-ops, columnar execution.

**Presto** (*Trino*)
: Distributed SQL query engine. Planned replacement for DuckDB when dataset >10TB or users >100.

---

### Data Pipeline

**Producer**
: Component that sends messages to Kafka (e.g., Binance client, Kraken client).

**Consumer**
: Component that reads messages from Kafka and writes to Iceberg.

**Streaming Source**
: External data provider (exchange, vendor) sending real-time data via WebSocket or FIX.

**Batch Source**
: Historical data loaded from CSV, Parquet, or database dumps.

---

### Schema and Data

**TradeV2**
: K2's second-generation trade schema using hybrid design (core fields + `vendor_data` map).

**QuoteV2**
: K2's second-generation quote schema.

**Vendor Data** (*Exchange-Specific Fields*)
: Flexible map field in V2 schemas for exchange-specific metadata (e.g., Binance aggregate ID, Kraken order ID).

**vendor_data**
: JSON map field in V2 schemas. Enables schema evolution without breaking compatibility.

**Avro**
: Binary serialization format used for Kafka messages. Supports schema evolution.

**Schema Registry**
: Service managing Avro schemas and enforcing compatibility (BACKWARD, FORWARD, FULL).

**Partition Key**
: Field used to distribute data across Kafka partitions or Iceberg files (typically `symbol` or `trade_date`).

---

### Query Patterns

**Time-Travel Query**
: Query historical data as it existed at a specific point in time using Iceberg snapshots.

**Snapshot**
: Immutable state of an Iceberg table at a specific commit. Enables time-travel queries and audit trails.

**Predicate Pushdown**
: Optimization where filters are pushed to storage layer, reducing data scanned.

**Partition Pruning**
: Optimization skipping irrelevant partitions based on query filters (e.g., only scan January data for January query).

---

### Data Quality

**Idempotency**
: Property where applying an operation multiple times has the same effect as once. K2 uses `message_id` for deduplication.

**At-Least-Once Delivery**
: Guarantee that messages are delivered one or more times. Duplicates possible, handled via deduplication.

**Exactly-Once Delivery**
: Guarantee that messages are delivered exactly once. Complex and expensive; K2 uses at-least-once + idempotency instead.

**Sequence Tracker**
: K2 component detecting gaps, resets, and out-of-order messages using exchange sequence numbers.

**DLQ** (*Dead-Letter Queue*)
: Storage for messages that failed processing (parse errors, validation failures). Enables manual review.

---

### Operational Concepts

**Graceful Degradation**
: Reducing functionality under load rather than crashing. K2 principle: degrade, never fail.

**Circuit Breaker**
: Pattern that stops operations after repeated failures, preventing cascading failures.

**Backpressure**
: Mechanism to slow down producers when consumers can't keep up.

**Consumer Lag**
: The difference between the latest message in Kafka and the message the consumer is currently processing.

---

## Technology Terms
