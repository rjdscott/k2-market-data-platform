## Why Archive Instead of Delete?

These files are archived rather than deleted to:
1. **Preserve history** - Track how the implementation plan evolved
2. **Reference decisions** - Understand why approaches changed
3. **Audit trail** - Maintain complete project documentation lineage

## Accessing Archived Documentation

Archived documentation is **read-only** and should not be updated. If you need information from an archived file:
1. Check if the current version has the information you need
2. If historical context is required, reference the archived file but cite the archive location
3. Never link to archived files from active documentation

## Archive Retention Policy

- **Keep**: All archived documentation (disk space is cheap)
- **Review**: Annually to ensure archive is still relevant
- **Delete**: Only with approval from Platform Lead
