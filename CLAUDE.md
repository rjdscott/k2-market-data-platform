# Claude Code Instructions

## Goal
Implement the project in a **Test-Driven Development (TDD) style**, focusing on clean, maintainable, and production-quality code. 

After each change, update relevant documentation (`@README.MD` and `@docs/`) to reflect new features, structure, or instructions.

## Guidelines
1. **TDD Workflow**
   - Write tests first for any new functionality or component.
   - Implement only enough code to make the tests pass.
   - Refactor code while keeping all tests passing.
   - Ensure test coverage is sufficient to verify core logic and edge cases.

2. **Documentation**
   - After completing each code change, update documentation to reflect:
     - New functionality or components
     - Updated usage instructions
     - Architecture changes or decisions
   - Keep documentation clear, concise, and consistent with TDD methodology.

3. **Best Practices**
   - Maintain clean code and proper separation of concerns.
   - Follow Staff/Principal Data Engineer standards in readability, structure, and maintainability.
   - Use Docker and `docker-compose` for all local testing and demonstration setups.
   - Ensure all changes are demonstrable and the platform runs cleanly at each step.

## Output
- Implemented code following TDD.
- Updated documentation reflecting changes.
- Step-by-step commit-style outputs are encouraged to demonstrate progression.
